        The Advanced Crop Management System is a state-of-the-art AI-powered tool designed to revolutionize

        1. Crop Recommendation: Based on soil composition and environmental factors, the system suggests 
           the most suitable crops for cultivation, optimizing yield and resource utilization.

        2. Plant Disease Prediction: Using computer vision and deep learning, the system can analyze images 
           of plant leaves to identify potential diseases, enabling early intervention and crop protection.

        This integrated approach aims to empower farmers and agricultural professionals with data-driven 
        insights, leading to more sustainable and productive farming practices.

        Follow these steps to get the most out of our Advanced Crop Management System:

        For Crop Recommendation:
        1. Navigate to the 'Crop Recommendation' tab.
        2. Input the required soil and environmental data accurately.
        3. Click on the 'Get Crop Recommendation' button.
        4. Review the recommended crop, its benefits, and seasonal information.

        For Plant Disease Prediction:
        1. Go to the 'Disease Prediction' tab.
        2. Ensure you have a clear, well-lit image of the plant leaf you want to analyze.
        3. Click on the 'Choose a leaf image...' button and select your image file.
        4. Once the image is uploaded and displayed, click on the 'Predict Disease' button.
        5. Wait for the AI model to process the image and generate results.
        6. Review the predicted disease and the confidence levels for different classes.

        For best results in disease prediction:
        - Use high-resolution images with good lighting conditions.
        - Ensure the leaf fills most of the frame and is in focus.
        - Include images of both the top and bottom of the leaf if possible.
        - Avoid using blurry, overexposed, or underexposed images.
        - If multiple leaves are affected, submit individual images for each leaf.

        Remember, while our system provides valuable insights, it's always recommended to consult with 
        agricultural experts for comprehensive advice on crop management and disease control.
